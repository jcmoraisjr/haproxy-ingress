# Deploying multi Haproxy Ingress Controllers

This example aims to demonstrate the Deployment of multi haproxy ingress controllers.

## Prerequisites

If you have another Ingress controller deployed, you will need to make sure your
Ingress resources target exactly one Ingress controller by specifying the
[ingress.class](/examples/PREREQUISITES.md#ingress-class) annotation as
`haproxy`.

This document has also the following prerequisites:

* Create a [TLS secret](/examples/PREREQUISITES.md#tls-certificates) named `tls-secret` to be used as default TLS certificate

Creating the TLS secret:

```console
$ openssl req \
  -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 365 \
  -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj '/CN=localhost'
$ kubectl create secret tls tls-secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key
$ rm -v tls.crt tls.key
```

## Default Backend

The default backend is a service of handling all url paths and hosts the haproxy controller doesn't understand. Ingress controller healthz port used for that.

## RBAC Authorization

Check the [RBAC sample](/examples/rbac) if deploying on a cluster with
[RBAC authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/).

## Ingress Deployment

Deploy the Deployment of multi controllers as follows:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f haproxy-ingress-deployment.yaml
deployment "haproxy-ingress" created
```

Check if the controller was successfully deployed:
```console
$ kubectl get deployment
NAME                   DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE     AVAILABLE   AGE
default-http-backend   1         1         1              1           30m
haproxy-ingress        2         2         2              2           45s

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default-http-backend-q5sb6              1/1       Running   0          35m
haproxy-ingress-1779899633-k045t        1/1       Running   0          1m
haproxy-ingress-1779899633-mhthv        1/1       Running   0          1m
```
