## Major improvements

Highlights of this version

* Embedded HAProxy upgrade from 2.3 to 2.4.
* Partial Gateway API v1alpha2 support, see the [Gateway API getting started page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/gateway-api/).
* [Coraza](https://coraza.io/) added as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) backend option, see the [example page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/examples/modsecurity/#using-coraza-instead-of-modsecurity).
* Option to customize the response payload for any of the status codes managed by HAProxy or HAProxy Ingress, see the [HTTP Responses](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#http-response) configuration key documentation.
* Option to run the embedded HAProxy as Master Worker. Running HAProxy as Master Worker enables [worker-max-reloads](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#master-worker) option without the need to configure as an external deployment, enables HAProxy logging to stdout, and also has a better management of the running process. This option is not enabled by default, see the [master worker documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/command-line/#master-worker) for further information.
* HAProxy Ingress can now be easily launched in the development environment with the help of the `--local-filesystem-prefix` command-line option. See also the command-line option [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/command-line/#local-filesystem-prefix) and the new `make` variables and targets in the [README](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/#develop-haproxy-ingress) file.

## Upgrade notes

Breaking backward compatibility from v0.13:

* Default `auth-tls-strict` configuration key value changed from `false` to `true`. This update will change the behavior of misconfigured client auth configurations: when `false` misconfigured mTLS send requests to the backend without any authentication, when `true` misconfigured mTLS will always fail the request. See also the [auth TLS documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#auth-tls).
* `auth-tls-verify-client`, when configured as `optional_no_ca`, used to validate client certificates against the configured CA bundle. This happens on controller versions from v0.8 to v0.13. Since v0.14 `optional_no_ca` will bypass certificate validation. Change `auth-tls-verify-client` to `optional` in order to preserve the old behavior.
* Default `--watch-gateway` command-line option changed from `false` to `true`. On v0.13 this option can only be enabled if the Gateway API CRDs are installed, otherwise the controller would refuse to start. Since v0.14 the controller will always check if the CRDs are installed. This will change the behavior on clusters that has Gateway API resources and doesn't declare the command-line option: v0.13 would ignore the resources and v0.14 would find and apply them. See also the [watch gateway documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/command-line/#watch-gateway).
* All the response payload managed by the controller using Lua script was rewritten in a backward compatible behavior, however deployments that overrides the `services.lua` script might break. See the [HTTP Responses](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#http-response) documentation on how to customize HTTP responses using controller's configuration keys.
* Two frontends changed their names, which can break deployments that uses the frontend name on metrics, logging, or in the `config-proxy` global configuration key. Frontends changed are: `_front_https`, changed its name to `_front_https__local` if at least one ssl-passthrough is configured, and `_front__auth`, changed its default value to `_front__auth__local`. These changes were made to make the metric's dashboard consistent despite the ssl-passthrough configuration. See the new [metrics example page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/examples/metrics/) and update your dashboard if using HAProxy Ingress' one.

# v0.14.10

## Reference (r10)

* Release date: `2025-10-10`
* Helm chart: `--version 0.14.10`
* Image (Quay): `quay.io/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.14.10`
* Image (Docker Hub): `docker.io/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.14.10`
* Embedded HAProxy version: `2.4.30`
* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.14.10`

## Release notes (r10)

This release updates the embedded haproxy version, which fixes CVE-2025-11230, see HAProxy release notes https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg46188.html . This CVE cannot be exploited on HAProxy Ingress because it does not use any of the vulnerable converters. A proxy without the fix can however be exploited by an internal user having access to the Ingress API, from a controller that does not deny configuration snippets via annotations.

Other issues were also found and fixed:

- Chitoku found a regression on some certificate related annotations not working with the `file://` protocol, after implementing global support on those annotations.
- Artyom found the fronting-proxy configuration overwriting the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header when both the fronting proxy and the regular HTTP shares the same TCP port number.

Dependencies:

- embedded haproxy from 2.4.29 to 2.4.30
- go from 1.23.11 to 1.23.12

## Fixes and improvements (r10)

Fixes and improvements since `v0.14.9`:

* fix reading backend ca certificate from file [#1297](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/pull/1297) (jcmoraisjr)
* fix xfp header on fronting proxy shared port [#1310](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/pull/1310) (jcmoraisjr)
* update go from 1.23.11 to 1.23.12 [6fcdcc9](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/commit/6fcdcc94204d701ab14ce15be776b27471d0f377) (Joao Morais)

# v0.14.9

## Reference (r9)

* Release date: `2025-07-29`
* Helm chart: `--version 0.14.9`
* Image (Quay): `quay.io/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.14.9`
* Image (Docker Hub): `docker.io/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.14.9`
* Embedded HAProxy version: `2.4.29`
* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.14.9`

## Release notes (r9)

This release updates the embedded haproxy version, dependencies, and fixes issues and vulnerabilities found in the v0.14 branch.

- An user with update ingress privilege can escalate their own privilege to the controller one, by exploring the config snippet annotation if it was not disabled via `--disable-config-keywords=*` command-line option. Mitigate this vulnerability by updating controller version, or disabling config snippet.
- Fixes a panic on controller shutdown due to closing the same connection twice, if its startup failed the very first reconciliation.
- Fixes a race during haproxy reload, when the controller connects fast enough via the master socket, finds the old instance still running and thinks it's the new one already. If this happens, it might lead to problems in the synchronization of the in-memory model to the running instance, sometimes making haproxy to reflect an older state.

Dependencies:

- embedded haproxy from 2.4.28 to 2.4.29
- go from 1.23.7 to 1.23.11

* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.14.8`

## Release notes (r8)

This release updates the embedded haproxy version, and fixes issues and vulnerable components found in the v0.14 branch.

- Robson, Moacir and Fabio found a memory leak on Gateway API reconciliation. Depending on the changes being applied, an older in memory representation of the load balancer state is referenced by the new one, creating a chain of old representations not having a chance to be collected by GC.
- rdavyd found an endpoint configuration overwrite in the case the same service, or a distinct service with the same endpoints are added in a single rule of a single HTTPRoute on Gateway API.
- Controller now retries to apply a haproxy reload in the case of a failure. Older controller versions didn't retry because all the failures are related with misconfiguration, but since master-worker and external modes are options, other network or socket related issues might happen.
- TCP services now supports a list of TLS certificates.
- All known vulnerable components were updated, like go's stdlib and `golang.org/x/crypto`

Dependencies:

- embedded haproxy from 2.4.26 to 2.4.28
- go from 1.19.13 to 1.23.7, having `//go:debug default=go1.19` for backward compatibility

## Release notes (r7)

This release updates the embedded haproxy version, and fixes some issues found in the v0.14 branch:

- Julien fixed the Vary response header, from Cors, when the backend server returns two or more headers
- tomklapka and Jan implemented a more fine grained response from Coraza WAF
- HAProxy process, when embedded and in master-worker mode, was being prematurelly stopped on rolling updates because it was configured in the same pid group of the controller
- Fix backend selection, when a more generic wildcard hostname was being incorrectly chosen, and it colides with a more specific one which uses mTLS
- Secure backend configuration, like backend protocol and client side mTLS, can now be configured globally for all ingress resources
- Auth external configuration can now be configured globally
- Make sure https redirect happens before path redirect when `app-root` is configured
- Added the steps to configure the embedded HAProxy process to log to stdout, along with controller, useful on dev or small test environments. See [doc](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#syslog)
- Added two distinct helm configurations on the getting started guide: one that uses a service load balancer, another one that uses http/s ports assigned to the cluster nodes. See [doc](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/getting-started/)

Dependencies:

- embedded haproxy from 2.4.25 to 2.4.26

* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.14.3`

## Release notes (r3)

This release fixes some issues found in the v0.14 branch:

- External HAProxy was failing with the message "cannot open the file '/var/lib/haproxy/crt/default-fake-certificate.pem'.". This happened due to missing permission to read certificate and private key files when HAProxy container starts as non root, which is the default since HAProxy 2.4.
- ConfigMap based TCP services was randomly missing when the controller started, being reincluded only after the first reconciliation.
- Gateway API v1alpha2 was missing delete events, which means that the controller wasn't updating the configuration when a Gateway API resource was removed.

Other notable changes include:

- Karan Chaudhary added EndpointSlices support. v0.14 branch has this option disabled by default, enable it by adding `--enable-endpointslices-api` command-line option.
- HTTP redirect now has an option to skip some paths, the default configuration adds an exception to `/.well-known/acme-challenge`.
- An update to the External HAProxy example page adds options to fix permission failures to bind ports `:80` and `:443`, see the [example page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/examples/external-haproxy/#a-word-about-security).

Dependencies:

- Update client-go from v0.23.16 to v0.24.14
- Update golang from 1.18.10 to 1.19.9

* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.14.1`

## Release notes (r1)

This release fixes the following issues:

- Service resources accept annotations just like ingress ones. However services annotated with path scoped annotations, like `haproxy-ingress.github.io/cors-enable` and `haproxy-ingress.github.io/auth-url`, were applying the configuration to just one of the paths pointing the service. So, considering `domain.local/path1` and `domain.local/path2` pointing to `svc1`, an annotation added to `svc1` would only be applied to one of the paths.
- A wrong named port configured on the external auth was being silently ignored. This update adds this information in the documentation and also adds a warning in the log. See auth external [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#auth-external).

Other notable changes include:

- Mutual TLS authentication (mTLS, Auth TLS) was being skipped on v0.14 if all the domains that configure mTLS are configured with `optional_no_ca`.

Dependencies:

- Embedded HAProxy version was updated from 2.4.20 to 2.4.21.
- Go updated from 1.18.9 to 1.18.10.
- Client-go updated from v0.23.15 to v0.23.16.

## Release notes (r0)

This is the first v0.14 release graduated as GA, which adds these major improvements since v0.13:

- [Coraza](https://coraza.io/) Web Application Firewall (WAF) support, see the example page [here](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/examples/modsecurity/#using-coraza-instead-of-modsecurity).
- Customization of all HAProxy generated response payload, see the documentation [here](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#http-response).
- Gateway API support improvement - although we're not fully compliant yet, see the documentation [here](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/gateway-api/).

The following improvements have been made since the last beta version:

- Michele Palazzi added a new configuration snippet that allows to add customized configurations before any builtin frontend logic.
- Ability to configure mutual TLS authentication without validating the client certificate. This adds a breaking backward compatibility from v0.13: `auth-tls-verify-client` configured as `optional_no_ca` used to make client certificate validation, now that validation is bypassed.

Dependencies:

- Embedded HAProxy version was updated from 2.4.19 to 2.4.20.
- Golang updated from 1.17.13 to 1.18.9
- Client-go updated from v0.23.14 to v0.23.15.

## Fixes and improvements (r0)

New features and improvements since `v0.14.0-beta.3`:

## Release notes (b3)

This is the third and last beta version of the v0.14 release branch. It fixed some minor issues:

- Embedded Acme signer can now sign certificates for hosts used on redirects
- `auth-headers-*` configuration keys, from Auth External, used to break the HAProxy configuration if declared empty. Now an empty value makes none of the headers being copied.

Other visible improvements include:

- Andrej Baran added support for Load Server State on external HAProxy
- Mac Chaffee added [Coraza WAF](https://coraza.io) support, see the [example page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/examples/modsecurity/#using-coraza-instead-of-modsecurity) on how to configure it.
- Zap added as an optional logger sink, which adds the ability to control a few more logging options. See the [logging command-line options doc](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/command-line/#logging).

Dependencies:

- Embedded HAProxy version was updated from 2.4.18 to 2.4.19.
- Client-go updated from v0.23.10 to v0.23.14.

* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.14.0-beta.2`

## Release notes (b2)

This is the second beta release of the v0.14 version, which fixes a small regression added in v0.8. Up to version v0.7 HAProxy Ingress accepted services of type External Name without port declaration, in this case the same port number configured in the ingress resource was used to configure the backend. Since the v0.8 refactor, a port configuration became mandatory in the service resource. This update brings the v0.7 behavior again, so services of type External Name have port declaration optional.

Other visible improvements include:

- Image generation now updates OS dependencies added by the upstream image, which avoids to release images with known vulnerabilities
- Manuel Rüger updated some old and deprecated dependency versions

Dependencies:

- Embedded HAProxy version was updated from 2.4.17 to 2.4.18.
- Golang updated from 1.17.11 to 1.17.13.
- Client-go updated from v0.23.8 to v0.23.10.

## Release notes (b1)

This is the first beta release of the v0.14 version, which fixes some issues from the previous tag:

- A possible typecast failure reported by monkeymorgan was fixed, which could happen on outages of the apiserver and some resources are removed from the api before the controller starts to watch the api again.
- A lock was added before checking for expiring certificates when the embedded acme client is configured. This lock prevents the check routine to read the internal model while another thread is modifying it to apply a configuration change.
- The external HAProxy now starts without a readiness endpoint configured. This avoids adding a just deployed controller as available before it has been properly configured. Starting liveness was raised in the helm chart, so that huge environments have time enough to start.

Other visible improvements include:

- Josh Soref fixed a lot of typos in the documentation and comments.
- wolf-cosmose implemented a regex based Cors Allow Origin option.
- Metrics example now uses Prometheus Operator and the service monitor provided by the helm chart.
- Some internal frontend names were changed to allow consistent metrics despite the ssl-passthrough configuration, see the [upgrade notes](#upgrade-notes).

Dependencies:

- Embedded HAProxy version was updated from 2.4.15 to 2.4.17.
- Golang updated from 1.17.8 to 1.17.11.
- Client-go updated from v0.23.5 to v0.23.8.

## Release notes (a2)

This is the second and last alpha release of v0.14, which fixes the following issues:

- The configured service was not being selected if the incoming path doesn't finish with a slash, the host is not declared in the ingress resource (using default host), the path type is Prefix, and the pattern is a single slash.
- Marvin Rösch fixed a delay of 5 seconds to connect to a server using a TCP service. Such delay happens whenever a host is used in the ingress resource and the SSL offload is made by HAProxy.

Other visible improvements include:

- Add compatibility with HAProxy 2.5 deployed as external/sidecar. Version 2.5 changed the lay out of the `show proc` command of the master API.
- Add the ability to overwrite any of the HAProxy generated response payloads, see the [HTTP Response documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#http-response)
- Add `ssl-fingerprint-sha2-bits` configuration key which adds a HTTP header with the SHA-2 fingerprint of client certificates.
- Update to the latest version of golang 1.17, client-go v0.23 and haproxy 2.4

There is also a few other internal and non visible improvements. First beta version should be tagged within a week or so, after finish some exploratory tests.
