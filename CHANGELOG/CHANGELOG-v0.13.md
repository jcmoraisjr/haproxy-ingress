## Major improvements

Highlights of this version

* HAProxy upgrade from 2.2 to 2.3.
* Add arm64 image
* Ingress API upgrade from `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` to `networking.k8s.io/v1`.
* Partial implementation of Gateway API - [doc](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/configuration/gateway-api/)
* TCP services using ingress resources - [doc](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/configuration/keys/#tcp-services)
* External authentication - [doc](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/configuration/keys/#auth-external)
* Several new custom configurations - [doc](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/configuration/keys/#configuration-snippet)

## Upgrade notes

Breaking backward compatibility from v0.12

* Kubernetes minimal version changed from 1.18 to 1.19.
* External HAProxy minimal version changed from 2.0 to 2.2.
* Threads: by default HAProxy process will automatically configure `nbthread` to the number of available CPUs, instead of `2`, if `nbthread` is not declared and the platform supports CPU affinity. There is no change in the behavior if `nbthread` is declared.
* Global ConfigMap: a missing ConfigMap configured with `--configmap` used to be ignored, now the controller will crash if the resource does not exist.
* TLS configuration: v0.12 and older versions add hostnames to the HTTP and HTTPS maps despite the TLS attribute configuration. v0.13 will only add hostnames to the HTTPS map if the Ingress' TLS attribute lists the hostname, leading to 404 errors on misconfigured clusters. This behavior can be changed with `ssl-always-add-https` as a global or per hostname configuration, see the configuration [doc](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/configuration/keys/#ssl-always-add-https).
* OAuth2: `auth-request.lua` was updated and also the haproxy variable name with user's email address. This update will not impact if neither the Lua script nor the `oauth2-headers` configuration key were changed.
* OAuth2 with external HAProxy sidecar: the new Lua script has dependency with `lua-json4` which should be installed in the external instance.
* Basic Authentication: `auth-type` configuration key was deprecated and doesn't need to be used. This will only impact deployments that configures the `auth-secret` without configuring `auth-type` - in this scenario v0.12 won't configure Basic Authentication, but v0.13 will.
* SSL passthrough: Hostnames configured as `ssl-passthrough` will now add non root paths `/` of these hostnames to the HAProxy's HTTP port. v0.12 and older controller versions log a warning and ignore such configuration. HTTPS requests have no impact.

# v0.13.19

## Reference (r19)

* Release date: `2025-10-10`
* Helm chart: `--version 0.13.19`
* Image (Quay): `quay.io/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.13.19`
* Image (Docker Hub): `docker.io/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.13.19`
* Embedded HAProxy version: `2.4.30`
* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.13.19`

## Release notes (r19)

This release updates the embedded haproxy version, which fixes CVE-2025-11230, see HAProxy release notes https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg46188.html . This CVE cannot be exploited on HAProxy Ingress because it does not use any of the vulnerable converters. A proxy without the fix can however be exploited by an internal user having access to the Ingress API, from a controller that does not deny configuration snippets via annotations.

Other issues were also found and fixed:

- Chitoku found a regression on some certificate related annotations not working with the `file://` protocol, after implementing global support on those annotations.
- Artyom found the fronting-proxy configuration overwriting the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header when both the fronting proxy and the regular HTTP shares the same TCP port number.

Dependencies:

- embedded haproxy from 2.4.29 to 2.4.30
- go from 1.23.11 to 1.23.12

## Fixes and improvements (r19)

* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.13.12`

## Release notes (r12)

This release fixes some issues found in the v0.13 branch:

- External HAProxy was failing with the message "cannot open the file '/var/lib/haproxy/crt/default-fake-certificate.pem'.". This happened due to missing permission to read certificate and private key files when HAProxy container starts as non root, which is the default since HAProxy 2.4.
- ConfigMap based TCP services was randomly missing when the controller started, being reincluded only after the first reconciliation.

Other notable changes include:

- An update to the External HAProxy example page adds options to fix permission failures to bind ports `:80` and `:443`, see the [example page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/examples/external-haproxy/#a-word-about-security).

Dependencies:

- Update client-go from v0.23.16 to v0.23.17

## Release notes (r11)

This release fixes CVE-2023-25725 on HAProxy. See HAProxy's release notes regarding the issue and a possible work around: https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg43229.html

Note also that HAProxy Ingress v0.13 used to follow HAProxy 2.3 branch, which is already deprecated. This release also changes HAProxy branch from 2.3 to 2.4. HAProxy has a good history of preserving backward compatibility and, while we prefer to stick on a single branch of our main dependencies, we cannot ignore a known vulnerability.

Dependencies:

- Embedded HAProxy version was updated from 2.3.21 to 2.4.22.

## Release notes (r10)

Warning: due to the update of some old dependencies with vulnerability, the Go version used to compile this release was updated from 1.16 to 1.17, and client-go was updated from v0.20 to v0.23.

This release fixes the following issues:

- Service resources accept annotations just like ingress ones. However services annotated with path scoped annotations, like `haproxy-ingress.github.io/cors-enable` and `haproxy-ingress.github.io/auth-url`, were applying the configuration to just one of the paths pointing the service. So, considering `domain.local/path1` and `domain.local/path2` pointing to `svc1`, an annotation added to `svc1` would only be applied to one of the paths.
- A wrong named port configured on the external auth was being silently ignored. This update adds this information in the documentation and also adds a warning in the log. See auth external [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/configuration/keys/#auth-external).

Other notable changes include:

- Services of type External Name can now be configured without a port number. If the port is missing in the service, the port number declared in the ingress resource is used.
- Andrej Baran made `load-server-state` to work on HAProxy deployed as an external container.
- Some redirect configuration keys have the ability to send a request to another domain or path. This was happening with ACME validation as well. Now a redirect will only be effective if the request isn't an ACME validation.
- Auth headers, from the auth external configuration keys, used to break the configuration when declared empty. Now an empty value disables the copy of the HTTP headers.

Dependencies:

- Go updated from 1.16.15 to 1.17.13.
- Client-go updated from v0.20.15 to v0.23.16.

* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.13.8`

## Release notes (r8)

This release fixes the following issues:

- A possible typecast failure reported by monkeymorgan was fixed, which could happen on outages of the apiserver and some resources are removed from the api before the controller starts to watch the api again.
- A lock was added before checking for expiring certificates when the embedded acme client is configured. This lock prevents the check routine to read the internal model while another thread is modifying it to apply a configuration change.
- The external HAProxy now starts without a readiness endpoint configured. This avoids adding a just deployed controller as available before it has been properly configured. Starting liveness was raised in the helm chart, so that huge environments have time enough to start.

Other notable changes include:

- Metrics example now uses Prometheus Operator and the service monitor provided by the helm chart.

Dependencies:

- Embedded HAProxy version was updated from 2.3.19 to 2.3.20. This is the latest HAProxy change, 2.3 branch is now considered unmaintained.

* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.13.7`

## Release notes (r7)

This release fixes the match of the Prefix path type when the host is not declared (default host) and the pattern is a single slash. The configured service was not being selected if the incoming path doesn't finish with a slash.

Other notable changes include:

- Add compatibility with HAProxy 2.5 deployed as external/sidecar. Version 2.5 changed the lay out of the `show proc` command of the master API.
- Embedded HAProxy version was updated from 2.3.17 to 2.3.19.

* Embedded HAProxy version: `2.3.17`
* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.13.6`

## Release notes (r6)

This release fixes the following issues:

- Backend configuration snippets with blank lines were being rejected due to a wrong parsing of a missing `--disable-config-keywords` command-line option.
- Annotation based TCP services were incorrectly fetching the SNI extension of an encrypted connection that's deciphered by HAProxy. `req.ssl_sni` was being used instead of `ssl_fc_sni`.

Besides that, a few other improvements were made:

- All `var()` sample fetch now have the `-m str` match method. This fixes compatibility with HAProxy 2.5, which now enforces a match method when using `var()`. This however isn't enough to use HAProxy 2.5 as an external HAProxy due to incompatibility changes made in the master socket responses, hence the update in the [supported HAProxy versions](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/#use-haproxy-ingress). A future HAProxy Ingress release will make v0.12 and v0.13 branches compatible with HAProxy 2.5.
- A new configuration key `session-cookie-domain` was added due to how modern browsers parses the `domain` cookie attribute. Prefer to use this new configuration key instead of `session-cookie-shared`. Further information can be found in the [affinity documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/configuration/keys/#affinity).
- Embedded HAProxy was updated from 2.3.16 to 2.3.17.
- client-go was updated from v0.20.14 to v0.20.15.

* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.13.5`

## Release notes (r5)

This release fixes the following issues:

- An error message was missing in the controller doesn't have permission to update a secret. The update is needed when the embedded acme signer is used. Before this update, a missing permission would fail the update of the secret without notifying the failure in the logs.
- Michał Zielonka fixed the overwrite of the Vary header when Cors is used with two or more Allow Origin.

There is also a number of new features and improvements:

- Mateusz Kubaczyk added an option to allow change the precedence from class annotation to IngressClass resource when both are used to classify an ingress resource.
- Added a configuration that allows to change the default certificate chain issued by Let's Encrypt. The old behavior and currently the default option builds a bundle whose the topmost certificate is issued by `DST X3`, which will fail if the client has `DST X3` on its trust store and uses openssl 1.0.x. See the [Let's Encrypt documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/) about the `DST X3` expiration.
- Full Gateway API implementation was rescheduled to v0.15 (Q2'22), while v0.14 will be updated to support v1alpha2 version with similar limitations of v0.13. See the [Gateway API documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.13/docs/configuration/gateway-api/).
- New target platforms: `arm/v7`, `arm/v6` and `s390x`, all of them for Linux.
- Embedded HAProxy was updated to 2.3.16.
- client-go was updated to v0.20.14.

## Release notes (r2)

This release fixes a couple of issues found in the v0.13 branch:

* An ingress resource configuration could not be applied if an ingress resource starts to reference a service that was already being referenced by another ingress;
* An invalid configuration could be generated, preventing haproxy to reload, if an invalid oauth or auth external configuration is added (e.g. missing service name) to a fraction of the paths of a backend;
* Updates to endpoints of a ConfigMap based TCP service wasn't being updated to the haproxy listener;
* Maël Valais fixed Gateway API's certificateRef configuration - v1alpha1 requires the group field but HAProxy Ingress was refusing "core" as its content. The merge was done to master before v0.13.0 tag, but the merge to v0.13 branch was missing.

Also, Wojciech Chojnowski added a new configuration key that allows to use the value of a HTTP header as the source address used by allow and deny lists, making it possible to properly configure source headers when HAProxy is behind a reverse proxy.

## Release notes (r0)

This is the first v0.13 release graduated as GA. The following fixes have been made since the last beta version:

- A failure in the synchronization between the in memory HAProxy model and the state of the running HAProxy instance was fixed. The internal model reflects how HAProxy should be configured based on ingress resources. The states can be out of sync when new empty slots are added to backends that weren't in edit state, and only affects sharded backends (`--backend-shards` > 0).
- Dynamic server certificate update was fixed. A HAProxy reload was always being scheduled due to an unrelated change in the internal model

Other notable changes are:

- Images for arm64 will be generated for v0.13 and newer versions
- A FAQ section was added in the documentation
- Neil made some improvements to the ModSecurity example
- Golang was updated to a new patch (still 1.15 branch) and also client-go library (still v0.20 branch)

# v0.13.0-beta.2

## Reference (b2)

* Release date: `2021-07-11`
* Helm chart: `--version 0.13.0-beta.2 --devel`
* Image (Quay): `quay.io/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.13.0-beta.2`
* Image (Docker Hub): `jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.13.0-beta.2`
* Embedded HAProxy version: `2.3.12`

## Release notes (b2)

The number of changes is unusual for a beta quality update. Some of the new features were missed when the first beta was tagged, and some of them updated the upgrade notes / backward compatibility changes:

* The default number of threads isn’t 2 anymore. If not provided, HAProxy will configure it based on the number of CPUs it is allowed to use and this should happen on platforms that support CPU affinity. Deployments that configure nbthread will not be affected.
* A missing ConfigMap configured in the command-line option `--configmap` will now crash the controller. This misconfiguration used to be ignored. v0.12 and older will warn without crashing.

Other notable changes are:

* Improvement of the synchronization between the HAProxy state and the in-memory model that reflects that state. The controller used to trust that a state change sent to the admin socket is properly applied. Now every HAProxy response is parsed and the controller will enforce a reload if it doesn’t recognize the change as a valid one.
* auth-url was incorrectly parsing an URL whose domain doesn’t have a dot, depending on the number of paths. This is a common scenario when a Kubernetes’ service name is used as a domain name. Besides that, a misconfigured oauth or external authentication were ignoring the configuration, leading the backend without the authentication. Now the attempt to configure oauth or auth external will deny requests to the backend in the case of a misconfiguration.
* An invalid configuration file could be built if all the parsed ingress resources don’t configure a hostname.
* Andrew Rodland added `assign-backend-server-id` configuration key that assigns predictable IDs to backend servers, improving hash based balance algorithms to properly work if the list of servers is partially changed.
* A new command-line option `—reload-interval` adds the ability to distinguish between the frequency that the controller parses configuration changes and tries to apply dynamically, and the frequency that HAProxy should be reloaded. The former should be as fast as possible, the later, depending on the frequency, could lead to a high memory consumption depending on the long running connections timeout, like websockets.
* Two new security options were added: `--disable-external-name` can be used to not allow backend server discovery using an external domain, and `--disable-config-keywords` can be used to partially or completely disable configuration snippets via ingress or service annotations.
* The `auth-request.lua` script, used by oauth and external authentication, was updated to the official version from Tim’s repository. We were using a customized version due to the new external authentication options, waiting for the contributions to get merged to the main line. There were no visible changes in the functionality.
* Paul improved the command-line documentation, adding some undocumented options that the controller supports.
