## Major improvements

Highlights of this version:

* Embedded HAProxy version update from 2.6 to 2.8.
* FastCGI protocol support.
* Clustered metrics via peers configuration, see how it works in the [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.16/docs/configuration/keys/#peers).

## Upgrade notes

Breaking backward compatibility from v0.15:

* HAProxy versions older than 2.4 are no longer supported in the External HAProxy deployment.
* Default load balance algorithm changed from Roundrobin to Random(2), see [this thread](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg46011.html) regarding the rationale behind this change.

### Deprecated command-line options

The `--enable-endpointslices-api` command-line option was deprecated on v0.16 and should be removed on a future version. See its documentation at the [v0.16 documentation page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.16/docs/configuration/command-line/#enable-endpointslices-api).

## Release notes (a2)

This is the second and last alpha version of the v0.16 branch. All the new functionalities are already implemented, we should start the beta releases as soon as we identify this release good enough for the new phase.

See below the highlights since the first alpha version:

- Peers configuration is now backend scoped, so distinct backends can have their own stick-tables synchronized on all HAProxy instances. There is a backward incompatibility change from the alpha.1 syntax: `peers-table` now is backend scoped, so use instead `peers-table-global` if a single global one is desired. See its new documentation here: https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.16/docs/configuration/keys/#peers
- Chitoku found a regression on CA secrets configured via `file://`, this syntax was not working since a change that made it possible to configure CA secrets globally.

Changes in dependencies:

- client-go from v0.33.4 to v0.34.1
- controller-runtime from v0.21.0 to v0.22.1
- go from 1.24.6 to 1.25.1

## Release notes (a1)

This is the first tag of the v0.16 branch, which brings most, if not all the breaking changes expected to the v0.16 release:

- Minimum HAProxy version on the External HAProxy topology changed from 2.2 to 2.4, due to a change on how Lua scripts are loaded.
- Default load balance algorithm was changed from Roundrobin to Random(2) if not declared in global ConfigMap or as a backend annotation.
- Code cleanup might have an impact in the case your workload depends on it somehow. Removed codes that might impact are:
  - Old controller engine was removed altogether, so the `"HAPROXY_INGRESS_RUNTIME" == "LEGACY"` envvar has no effect.
  - Endpoints API was deprecated on Kubernetes 1.33 and removed from our v0.16 codebase, HAProxy Ingress now uses only EndpointSlice API.

We should have at least one other alpha/snapshot release, and we will report any new breaking changes on its release notes in the case it happens.

Besides that, the following areas had some improvement since v0.15:

- Embedded HAProxy version changed from 2.6 to 2.8.
- FastCGI protocol is now supported, both plain and on top of TLS. See its [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.16/docs/configuration/keys/#fastcgi).
- Clustered metrics, non centralized, via peers configuration. HAProxy Ingress configures every HAProxy instance to talk to each other to share their local metrics. Note that alpha.1 supports only global configuration with a single shared stick table, a backend scoped configuration should be done for alpha.2. See its [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.16/docs/configuration/keys/#peers).
- Customized proxy HTTP responses are now Host/Backend scoped, so they can be configured per hostname or backend via ingress or service annotation. See its [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.16/docs/configuration/keys/#http-response).
- Better support for a namespaced controller by adding the `--disable-ingress-class-api` command-line option. See its [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.16/docs/configuration/command-line/#ingress-class).
- Code cleanup: legacy controller code (on behalf of controller-runtime), deprecated Endspoins API (on behalf of EndpointSlice), and deprecated structs used to track changes on a former HAProxy Ingress version.

Dependencies:

- embedded haproxy from 2.6.22 to 2.8.15
- client-go from v0.32.8 to v0.33.4
- controller-runtime from v0.20.4 to v0.21.0
- go from 1.23.12 to 1.24.6
